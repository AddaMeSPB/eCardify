Your next business card doesn't need paper. It needs eCardify.

eCardify is the digital business card app for iPhone. Create a professional virtual business card in under 2 minutes, save it to Apple Wallet for instant access, and share it with anyone via QR code, AirDrop, iMessage, or email. No app needed on the other end.

WHY GO DIGITAL?

Paper business cards get lost, bent, coffee-stained, and thrown away. You run out at the worst moments. You reprint 500 cards every time your phone number or title changes.

A digital business card never runs out, never gets lost, and updates instantly. When you change jobs or get a new number, update your eCardify card once — everyone who has your QR code gets your latest info automatically.

KEY FEATURES

APPLE WALLET INTEGRATION
Your digital business card lives in Apple Wallet — right next to your boarding passes, loyalty cards, and payment methods. One swipe from your lock screen and you're ready to share.

QR CODE — SCAN & SHARE
Every eCardify card has a unique QR code. The person you're meeting scans it with their phone camera — no app required — and instantly gets your contact details.

PAPER CARD SCANNER
Still collecting paper business cards at events? Scan them with eCardify's built-in scanner. The app reads the card, extracts contact information, and creates a digital contact automatically.

PROFESSIONAL TEMPLATES
Choose from a range of professionally designed templates and color schemes. Add your name, job title, company, phone number, email address, website, and social links.
